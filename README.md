# Packer Ubuntu
This repo contains a image to create an automated virtual machine to setup and configure Ubuntu with the predefinned parameters.

I have used this template to use with ansible (ansible config not in repo).
This configuration will pull the iso file from the internet (of your datastore depending on your needs), and build the image using the cloud-init config.
